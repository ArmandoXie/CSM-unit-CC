With the rise of 5G network, programming software is not only a tool that only programmers can learn and use. Now many designers and artists are learning program language by themselves. Through computer language, they can not only use static images and text, but also use dynamic interactive models to make the expression of works more accurate.

If you happen to have the ability to write a computer language, you can create a masterpiece in your mind, designed to run a program that implements it, so that not only is the content of your work an art, but also its tools, form, and process of creation an art installation.
