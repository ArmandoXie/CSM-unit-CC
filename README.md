# CSM GCD-unit2-CC
I always wanted to learn about coding to expand my skill set in my art and design career to realize the potential ideas.
With the rise of 5G network, programming software is not only a tool that only programmers can learn and use. Now many designers and artists are learning program language by themselves. Through computer language, they can not only use static images and text, but also use dynamic interactive models to make the expression of works more accurate.

If you happen to have the ability to write a computer language, you can create the masterpiece in your mind, designed to run a program that implement.
Interactivity is to bring cold digital products closer to our life and have close contact with our sensibility. In conclusion, discussing interactivity is actually discussing the role of human beings in science and technology. Boring programming actually has a deeper meaning, which also leads us to focus on when and how to combine design and art with programming.

The main idea of ‘Virtual Depictions:San Francisco’ is to bring 21st century approach to public art to define new poetics of space through media arts and architecture and to create a unique parametric data sculptures that has an intelligence, memory and culture. Through architectural transformations of media wall located in 350 Mission’ lobby, main motivation with this seminal media architecture approach is to frame this experience with a meticulously abstract and cinematic site-specific data-driven narration. As a result, this media wall turns into a spectacular public event making direct and phantasmagorical connections to its surroundings through simultaneous juxtapositions.

The development of large-scale renewable sources of energy has become the quest of our time and the only possible future. Solar energy, therefore, has emerged as one of our saviors; the sun is once again the god of life. But what will happen when the sun disappears? Should we plan for such a distant future? Can we even imagine it? What happens after the future?
The End of the Sun is a countdown system that utilizes solar energy to bring us closer to the distant future in which the sun will consume all its fuel and cool down — in about 14.4 billion years. Thus, this installation is a paradoxical countdown timer that starts at 454.118.400.000.000.000 (the number of seconds in 14.4 billion years) and utilizes solar energy to power its display and the electronic system.

This project is definitely challenging me to get out of my comfort zone to learn new techniques, it's because I haven't separated from my deep-rooted learning habits in the past into this whole new experience.
